## Introduction
A randomly desensitized sampled dataset from one of the large-scaled production dataset from from Lazada (Alibaba Group) is included. The dataset contains three dataframes corresponding users' voucher collection logs, related user behavior logs and related item features stored in a pickle (.pkl) file .

To use the dataset, first unzip the file with command line:

	cd ./data
	unzip kdd_data.pkl.zip

Then the dataframes can be loaded with the following Python codes from the pickle file:

	import pickle
	file_path = './data/kdd_data.pkl'
	with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
	    log_df = pickle.load(f)
	    session_df = pickle.load(f)
	    item_df = pickle.load(f)
	log_df.shape, session_df.shape, item_df.shape

The description of each dataframe is as, note that all id features such as user_id, item_id, promotion_id, etc is hashed and desensitized, the timestamp is also hashed while the chronological order is preserved.

## 1. Voucher Collection Log (log_df) :
Users' voucher collection logs from Lazada voucher business which contains 62,068 records and 19 columns. Each record corresponding to a voucher being collected by a user with label = 0/1 represents whether the user redeems the voucher, the associated collection and redemption (if any) timestamp and user's profile feature is included as well. Data type and description of each column is as follows:
